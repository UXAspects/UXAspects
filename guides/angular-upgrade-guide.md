# Upgrading Angular 1 Application

### Overview

##### Step One
- Adding TypeScript
- Adding Webpack
- Create Hybrid Application
- Consuming Angular 4+ Components

##### Step Two
- Begin Migration
- Upgrade Tips and Notes

##### Step Three
- Deprecate Angular 1


## Adding TypeScript

TypeScript is a superset of Javascript that allow us to use static typing in our web applications. It comes with many benefits such as better tooling, including the ability to add intelligent code completion in editors, and compile time error checking. 

Angular 4+ recommends the use of TypeScript for building applications and provides the most comprehensive support and documentation for TypeScript.

We can easily add TypeScript to an existing project using NPM:

```
npm install typescript --save-dev
```

To configure TypeScript we should add a `tsconfig.json` file to the root directory of the project. The example below should provide a good starting point:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es5",
    "module": "commonjs",
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "sourceMap": true,
    "emitDecoratorMetadata": true,
    "experimentalDecorators": true,
    "removeComments": false,
    "noImplicitAny": false,
    "suppressImplicitAnyIndexErrors": true,
    "lib": ["es2015", "dom"]
  }
}
```

## Adding Webpack

Webpack is a module loader and bundler tool that allows us to use ES2015 modules in our code providing us with better encapsulation and other great features such as tree shaking which outputs only the parts of code that are actually used rather than simply concatenating all script files as was traditionally done.

Additionally Webpack has many additional features such as providing a local web server, automatic reloading, building Less or Sass through loaders and much more.

We can include Webpack in our project by running the following command in the command prompt:

```
npm install webpack --save-dev
```

To allow us to run Webpack from the command line you should install Webpack globally:

```
npm install webpack -g
```

We will configure Webpack after we have our Hybrid application set up.

## Create Hybrid Application

#### Installing Dependencies

To begin creating our hybrid application we need to install Angular 4+ and its dependencies. We can do this by running the following in the command prompt:

```
npm install @angular/common @angular/compiler @angular/core @angular/forms @angular/http @angular/platform-browser @angular/platform-browser-dynamic @angular/router @angular/upgrade @types/node core-js rxjs zone.js --save-dev
```

Additionally we should install typings for Angular 1. Type Definition files are files used by TypeScript to know which functions and properties a library (not written in TypeScript) exposes and what types they accept and return. They are similar to header files in C++.

```
npm install @types/jasmine @types/angular  @types/angular-animate @types/angular-cookies @types/angular-mocks @types/angular-resource @types/angular-route @types/angular-sanitize --save-dev
```

#### Creating Angular 4+ Application

We can now begin creating our Angular 4+ application that will run alongside the Angular 1 application. 

It is often useful to create a separate folder under the `src` folder to contain our Angular 4+ files so that we can easily identify which files are part of the Angular 1 app and which are part of the Angular 4+ app.

We need to start by adding an entry point for our Angular 4+ application, which is usually done by creating a `main.ts` file. In this file we can import some required libraries and bootstrap our Angular 4+ application.

```typescript
import 'core-js/es6';
import 'core-js/es7/reflect';
require('zone.js/dist/zone');

import { platformBrowserDynamic } from '@angular/platform-browser-dynamic';
import { AppModule } from './app.module';

platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule);
```

The `main.ts` references an `AppModule` file which we need to create in a file named `app.module.ts`. 

In our `AppModule` we need to import the `UpgradeAdapter` tool which allows us to both upgrade Angular 1 components to Angular 4+ and to downgrade Angular 4+ components to Angular 1 which can be very useful when migrating our applications.

We should export the instance of the `UpgradeAdapter` so it is a singleton that can be used throughout the application.

We also need to bootstrap the Angular 1 from this file also - this mean you should remove the existing Angular 1 bootstrapping which is usually an `ng-app` attribute in your `index.html` file.

```typescript
import { NgModule, forwardRef } from '@angular/core';
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { UpgradeAdapter } from '@angular/upgrade';

// create a singleton of the upgrade adapter
export const upgradeAdapter = new UpgradeAdapter(forwardRef(() => AppModule));

@NgModule({
    imports: [
        BrowserModule
    ]
})
export class AppModule {
    ngDoBootstrap() {}
}

// bootstrap the Angular 1 application here
upgradeAdapter.bootstrap(document.documentElement, ['app']);
```

#### Configuring Webpack

Now that we have our Angular 4+ application set up we can configure Webpack to bundle it for us. We do this in a `webpack.config.js` file in the root directory of our project. Below is an example of how the file may initially look.

```javascript
var webpack = require('webpack');
var path = require('path');

module.exports = {

    entry: {
        bundle: './src/app4/main.ts'
    },

    output: {
        path: path.join(__dirname, 'dist', 'js'),
        filename: '[name].js'
    },

    resolve: {
        extensions: ['.ts', '.js']
    },

    module: {
        rules: [{
            test: /\.ts$/,
            include: path.join(__dirname, 'src', 'app4'),
            loaders: ['awesome-typescript-loader', 'angular2-template-loader']
        }, {
            test: /\.html$/,
            loader: 'html-loader'
        }]
    },

    plugins: [
        // Workaround for angular/angular#11580
        new webpack.ContextReplacementPlugin(
            /angular(\\|\/)core(\\|\/)@angular/,
            path.resolve(__dirname, 'docs')
        )
    ]
};
```

To run Webpack we first need to install any loaders that our configuration has used and we can do this using NPM:

```
npm install awesome-typescript-loader angular2-template-loader html-loader --save-dev
```


#### Running Webpack

We can run Webpack from the command line by running the following:

```
webpack --progress --colors
```

Additionally we can supply the `--watch` parameter which will keep Webpack alive, watch for any changes to files and incrementally rebuild anything that is required.

Webpack can also be run as part of an existing Grunt or Gulp build with plugins available through NPM.

Next we need to ensure we include the Webpack bundle in our `index.html` file. We should include the script after the Angular 1 script eg:

```html
<!--  Angular 1 Application -->
<script src="js/app.js"></script>

<!--  Angular 4 Application -->
<script src="js/bundle.js"></script>
```

#### Setup Complete

The hybrid application is now setup, and you should now have both Angular 1 and Angular 4+ running in the same application. You can now easily begin to use Angular 4+ components in your Angular 1 application.


## Consuming Angular 4+ Components/Services

We can now begin to use Angular 4+ components and services in our Angular 1 applications simply by importing them and using the `UpgradeAdapter` to downgrade them to Angular 1 components.

This process should work for components or services that are part of UX Aspects or any other components library.

For this example we are going to create a new Angular 4+ component and downgrade it to Angular 1. In the folder containing our Angular 4+ app create a folder called `components` that will store all our Angular 4+ components. Each component should be given its own sub folder.

Let's create a new `test` folder under `components` and add a `test.component.ts` file with the following contents:

```typescript
import { Component } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
    selector: 'test',
    template: `<h1>{{ text }}</h1>`
})
export class TestComponent {

    public text: string;

    constructor() {
        this.text = 'Component is Working!';
    }
}
```

We can then import this into our `AppModule` and downgrade it to and Angular 1 directive:

```typescript
// Inform TypeScript there is a global variable for AngularJS and state the associated type
declare var angular: angular.IAngularStatic;

import { NgModule, forwardRef } from '@angular/core';
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { UpgradeAdapter } from '@angular/upgrade';

// import Angular 4+ components
import { TestComponent } from './components/test/test.component';

// create a singleton of the upgrade adapter
export const upgradeAdapter = new UpgradeAdapter(forwardRef(() => AppModule));

@NgModule({
    imports: [
        BrowserModule
    ],
    declarations: [
        TestComponent
    ]
})
export class AppModule {
    ngDoBootstrap() {}
}

// downgrade the Angular 4+ component and register it as an Angular 1 directive
angular.module('app').directive('test', upgradeAdapter.downgradeNg2Component(TestComponent) as angular.IDirectiveFactory);

// bootstrap the Angular 1 application here
upgradeAdapter.bootstrap(document.documentElement, ['app']);
```

To test this directive simply add the `<test></test>` tag to your HTML.

There is also a `downgradeNg2Provider` function on the `UpgradeAdpater` instance that allows us to use any Angular 4+ service in our Angular 1 application.

> **Note:** There is no wrapper function for non-component directives.

## Begin Migration

At this point you should now be able to begin migrating your existing application to Angular 4+ at a pace that suits you.

Angular 4 provides us with useful upgrade and downgrade tools that allow us to expose components and services to each framework, however there is no tool to upgrade or downgrade non-component directives. So migrating any non-component directives early will help make sure everything you need is available once you start migrating components.

When you are ready to start migrating components/services, it is important to identify which components/services have the fewest dependencies and migrate these first.

Once you have migrated a component to Angular 4+ you can remove the Angular 1 variant, import it into your `AppModule` and downgrade it as shown in the above section. This will allow you to continue using it within your Angular 1 application until you have converted the entire application at which point you would remove Angular 1 completely.

If you upgrade a component or service that has a dependency that you have not yet migrated you can use the `UpgradeAdapter` module to upgrade Angular 1 components/services to Angular 4+ until you have migrated them. For more information on this [look here](https://angular.io/docs/js/latest/api/upgrade/index/UpgradeAdapter-class.html).

#### Components

Converting basic components should be relatively straightforward if your directives follow the most popular best practice guides. The majority of the work is simply converting the directive definition object to the component decorator. 

A complete guide on migrating can be [found here](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/upgrade.html).

##### Things to note:

- Each Angular 4+ component always has its own isolated scope
- It must have a template
- No longer a concept of `compile` or `link` functions
- No more `$apply` or `$digest`

##### Example

This is an example component that displays some text and changes the text when it is clicked.

###### Angular 1

```javascript
angular.module('app').directive('myComponent', function() {
	return {
    	restrict: 'E',
        scope: {
        	title: "="
        },
        controller: function() {
        	var vm = this;
            
            vm.updateText = function() {
            	vm.title = "Text Clicked";	
            };
        },
        controllerAs: 'vm',
        bindToController: true,
        template: "<h1 ng-click="vm.updateText()">{{ title }}</h1>"
    };
});
```

###### Angular 4+

```typescript
@Component({
	selector: 'my-component',
    template: '<h1 (click)="updateText()">{{ title }}</h1>'
})
export class MyComponent {
	@Input() title: string;
    
    updateText() {
    	this.title = "Text Clicked"
    }
}
```

#### Services

Angular 4+ injectables tend to be most similar to Angular 1 services, and the Angular 4+ version is essentially just an annotated class. 

##### Example

###### Angular 1

```javascript
angular.module("app").service("exampleDataService", function() {

	var data = [...];

	return {
    	getData: function() {
        	return data;
        },
        getPage: function(pageNumber, pageSize) {
			var startIndex = pageNumber * pageSize;
            var endIndex = startIndex + pageSize;
            
			return data.slice(startIndex, endIndex);
        }
    };
});
```

###### Angular 4+

```typescript
@Injectable()
export class ExampleDataService {
	
    private data = [...];
    
    getData() {
    	return data;
    }
    
     getPage(pageNumber, pageSize) {
        let startIndex = pageNumber * pageSize;
        let endIndex = startIndex + pageSize;

        return data.slice(startIndex, endIndex);
    }
}
```

#### Pages

In Angular 1 it was common practice to have an HTML file as a page in your application and associate a controller with either it or part of it by using a router or the `ng-controller` directive.

In Angular 4+ everything should be a component. There should be no html page files that aren't associated with a component. Because of this you should convert each page to a component.

##### Example

###### Angular 1

*HTML*
```html
<div class="wrapper" ng-controller="PageCtrl as vm">
	<table>
    	<thead>
        	...
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        	<tr ng-repeat="row in vm.tableData">
            	...
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
</div>
```

*Controller*
```javascript
angular.module('app').controller('PageCtrl', function() {
	var vm = this;
    
    vm.tableData = [
    	...
    ];
    
    vm.pageSize = 10;
    
    vm.getPage = function(pageNumber) {
    	let startIndex = pageNumber * vm.pageSize;
        let endIndex = startIndex + vm.pageSize;

        return data.slice(startIndex, endIndex);
    };
});
```

###### Angular 4

*HTML*
```html
<div class="wrapper">
	<table>
    	<thead>
        	...
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        	<tr *ngFor="let row of tableData">
            	...
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
</div>
```

*Component*
```typescript
@Component({
	selector: 'page-component',
    templateUrl: './page.component.html'
})
export class PageComponent {
	
    private tableData: any[] = [...];
    private pageSize: number = 10;
    
    getPage(pageNumber: number) {
    	let startIndex = pageNumber * this.pageSize;
        let endIndex = startIndex + this.pageSize;

        return data.slice(startIndex, endIndex);
    };
}
```

This will allow you to continue using your Angular 1 router, but instead of specifying an HTML file for a route, change it to display the downgraded Angular 4+ component, eg:

###### Before
```javascript
$stateProvider.state('page', {
  templateUrl: 'pages/page.html'
})
```

###### After
```javascript
$stateProvider.state('page', {
  template: '<page-component></page-component>'
})
```

Once all the pages in your application have been upgraded you can then easily switch out the Angular 1 router for the Angular 4 router as it expects components instead of urls.

## Upgrade Tips and Notes

#### Angular 4+ Directives

Directives provided as part of Angular 4+ do not work when used in an Angular 1 application, for example `ngFor`, `ngIf` and also including `ngModel` from the `FormsModule`. 

While this can be inconvenient, the Angular 1 equivalent (eg. `ng-if` and `ng-repeat`) directives should work as expected and be able to fulfil your requirements. 

The exception to the rule is `ng-model` which will not work across the two frameworks. To work around this issue all UX Aspects components that accept `ngModel` will have an additional two-way property you can bind to that will provide the same functionality.

#### Component Templates

When using both Angular 1 and Angular 4+ components within the one application you need to ensure that any component used in a component's template has either been upgraded or downgraded to the appropriate framework. 

For example if I have the following components:

```typescript
@Component({
	selector: 'my-component',
    template: '<h1>{{ title }}</h1>'
})
export class MyComponent {
	public title = "My Component";
}
```

```javascript
angular.module('app').directive('parentComponent', function() {
	return {
    	restrict: 'E',
        template: '<my-component></my-component>'
    };
});
```

You will need to have made sure that the Angular 4+ component has been downgraded and registered as an Angular 1 directive:

```typescript
angular.module('app').directive('myComponent', upgradeAdapter.downgradeNg2Component(MyComponent) as angular.IDirectiveFactory);
```

Inversely the same is also true. If I have the following components:

```javascript
angular.module('app').directive('myComponent', function() {
	return {
    	restrict: 'E',
        template: '<h1>{{ vm.title }}</h1>',
        controller: function() {
        	var vm = this;
            
            vm.title = "Working";
        },
        controllerAs: 'vm'
    };
});
```

```typescript
@Component({
	selector: 'parent-component',
    template: '<my-component></my-component>'
})
export class ParentComponent {}
```

In this case you will need to make sure the Angular 1 component has been upgraded to an Angular 4+ component:

```typescript
@NgModule({
    imports: [
        BrowserModule
    ],
    declarations: [
        upgradeAdapter.upgradeNg1Component('myComponent')
    ]
})
export class AppModule {
    ngDoBootstrap() { }
}
```

#### Limitations Upgrading Angular 1 Components

There are a few features of Angular 1 directives that are not supported by the upgrade tool. These include `compile` function, `postLink` function, `attributes` as a link function parameter, injection of `$attrs` or `$transclude` to a controller and the `replace` property.

Any component directives that use these features can either be modified or a simple wrapper directive can be created, which essentially creates an Angular 1 container, in which your existing Angular 1 component can run correctly even if it uses some of the unsupported features.

Here is an example of an Angular 1 component that uses some unsupported features:

```javascript
angular.module('app').directive('myNg1Component', function() {
    return {
        restrict: 'E',
        replace: true,
        scope: {
            upper: '=',
            lower: '='
        },
        template: '<p>The values are: {{ upper }} and {{ lower }}</p>',
        compile: function() {
            // ...
        }
    };
});
```

That component will likely not work correctly if simply upgraded using the upgrade tool:

```javascript
upgradeAdapter.upgradeNg1Component('myNg1Component')
```

However we can create a wrapper directive that takes the same inputs and simply passes them to the original component, eg:

```javascript
angular.module('app').directive('myNg1ComponentWrapper', function() {
    return {
        restrict: 'E',
        scope: {
            upper: '=',
            lower: '='
        },
        template: '<my-ng1-component lower="lower" upper="upper"></my-ng1-component>'
    };
});
```

As this wrapper directive uses no unsupported features we can simply use the upgrade module to make this component available in Angular 4:

```javascript
upgradeAdapter.upgradeNg1Component('myNg1ComponentWrapper')
```


#### Interacting with Angular 4+ components

When passing data to and from Angular 4+ components you must use the appropriate Angular 4+ syntax, even though we are running within an Angular 1 application.

For example, let's take the `ux-checkbox` component which has several attributes we can use to pass data to and from the component.

##### Literals
If we want to pass a value as a literal we can simply use a regular attribute:

```html
<ux-checkbox simplified="true"></ux-checkbox>
```

##### Bindings

To pass a variable in a controller to a component you should use `[]` to surround the attribute name:

```htlm
<ux-checkbox [simplified]="vm.simplified"></ux-checkbox>
```

##### Two Way Bindings

To pass a value to a component that you expect the component to update you can wrap the attribute name in `[()]`:

```html
<ux-checkbox [(value)]="value"></ux-checkbox>
```

## Deprecate Angular 1

Once you have migrated all your Angular 1 components, directives and services and are no longer dependent on any Angular 1 libraries you are now ready to deprecate Angular 1. You can simply remove any files containing old Angular 1 content, and remove any references to Angular 1 and outdated libraries in your `package.json` or `bower.json` files.

Your application is now fully Angular 4+!
