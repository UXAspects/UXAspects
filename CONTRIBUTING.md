# Contributing to UX Aspects

Contributing is easy, and all fixes no matter how small are welcome.

### Before you get started

Before you get started it is good to be aware of some of the practices we adhere to. We have a Developer Standard document that outlines some of the coding best practices we adhere to. We have several linting tasks that help us enforce these standards, and they should be run before creating a Pull Request.

### How to contribute

1. Fork the UX Aspects repository
2. Clone your forked repository
3. Make your fix/changes
4. Run our linting tasks using `grunt lint`.
5. Commit and Push your changes
6. Create a Pull Request

Once a Pull Request has been made it will be reviewed by one of our team members. If the Pull Request is approved it will be merged into UX Aspects allowing everyone else to benefit from your work.
