# Contributing to UX Aspects

Found a bug or thought of a new feature that would benefit others? Well you can help make UX Aspects even better by contributing to the project.
Contributing is easy, and all fixes are welcome, no matter how small.

### Before you get started

Before you get started it is good to be aware of some of the practices we adhere to. We have a [Developer Standard](https://github.com/UXAspects/UXAspects/blob/develop/guides/developer-standard.md) document that outlines some of the coding best practices we follow. We have several linting tasks that help enforce these standards and they should be run before creating a Pull Request.

### How to contribute

1. Fork the UX Aspects repository - This can be done on GitHub by clicking the "Fork" button on the UX Aspects repository page.
2. Clone your forked repository.
3. Make your fix/changes.
4. Run our linting tasks using `grunt lint`.
5. Run our tests using `grunt e2e` (note: The UX Aspects library must be built before this can run. This can be done by running `grunt build`).
6. Commit and Push your changes.
7. Create a Pull Request - This can be done on GitHub by clicking the "New Pull Request" button on the UX Aspects repository page.

Once a Pull Request has been made it will be reviewed by one of our team members. If the Pull Request is approved it will be merged into UX Aspects allowing everyone else to benefit from your work.
