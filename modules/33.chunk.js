End-to-end (E2E) tests build on unit tests by combining units of code and testing that the resulting combination functions correctly. They test a particular feature for correctness by comparing the results for a given input against the specification e.g. &apos;pressing button X should result in checkbox Y becoming disabled&apos;.</p>\n<p>Protractor is an end-to-end, open source test framework for Angular. It uses the Jasmine framework by default and runs on top of Selenium WebDriver. Tests may be run against a local Selenium server or against a remote server e.g. a Selenium Grid system. Tests may be written in JavaScript and TypeScript.</p>\n<p>The UXAspects project includes a suite of E2E tests in the &apos;e2e&apos; folder of the project repository.</p>\n<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>\n<p>Install <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a>, which provides the npm package manager.</p>\n<p>Execute the command <code>npm install -g grunt-cli</code> to install the grunt command line interface.</p>\n<p>Follow the instructions in the &quot;Building from Source&quot; section in the <a href="https://uxaspects.github.io/UXAspects/#/gettingstarted">Getting Started</a> page of the UX Aspects documentation to build the components to be tested.</p>\n<p>Before the first test run, execute <code>./node_modules/.bin/webdriver-manager update</code> to download the binaries necessary to get an instance of the Selenium Server running.</p>\n<p>Execute the command <code>grunt e2e</code> to run the tests.</p>\n<h3 id="architecture">Architecture</h3>\n<p>All Protractor methods are asynchronous and return promises. WebDriver maintains a queue of pending promises called the control flow. Promises are queued and resolved in the order they were created in.</p>\n<p>In our tests, elements are located on the test page by using &apos;by.ID&apos; and &apos;by.CSS&apos; locators.</p>\n<p>The Protractor global elements() function takes a locator for an element and returns that element. When using CSS selectors as a locator, the shortcut $() notation may be used. For example, <code>checkbox1.$(&apos;div .ux-checked&apos;)</code> is the same as <code>checkbox1.element(by.css(&apos;div .ux-checked&apos;))</code>.</p>\n<p>Multiple DOM elements may be found using the global element.all() function. As with single elements, a shortcut notation, $$(), may be used. For example <code>textsContainer.$$(&apos;em&apos;).get(1)</code> is the same as <code>textsContainer.elements.all(by.css(&apos;em&apos;).get(1))</code> and returns the second of an array of &apos;em&apos; elements.</p>\n<h3 id="test-organisation">Test organisation</h3>\n<h4 id="html-files">HTML files</h4>\n<p>The components being tested are grouped in HTML pages under the e2e/pages folder.</p>\n<p>The tests to be run against these pages are found under the e2e/tests folder.</p>\n<p>The e2e/protractor.config.js configuration file defines the location of the test files to be executed (in the &apos;specs&apos; property) and the URL for the Selenium server. The browser the tests are to run in is defined in the &apos;capabilities&apos; property (at the moment tests are run only in Chrome).</p>\n<h4 id="page-objects">Page Objects</h4>\n<p>When writing Protractor tests, it is good practice to place information about the location of elements in &apos;page object&apos; files, separate from the definitions of the tests themselves.</p>\n<p>A page object is a class that serves as an interface to the UI page being tested. The tests then use the methods of this class whenever they need to interact with that page.</p>\n<p>Encapsulating this information in a separate file means that if the organization of the page being tested changes, only the code within the page object needs to change. The tests themselves can remain unchanged. In addition, the Protractor-specific terms used to locate elements on the page are restricted to the page object files, making the test specification files easier to read.</p>\n<h4 id="test-specifications">Test specifications</h4>\n<p>The test instructions themselves are written using Jasmine syntax in test specification files.

Angular Language Service</h3>\n<p>The Angular Language Service is an extension being developed by the Angular team and provides some incredibly useful features. The extension is aware of when you are working in a component template file and will provide you with auto complete suggestions, error checking and the ability to Ctrl+Click on a component, variable or function and jump to the implementation or declaration.

How do I benefit from using UX Aspects in my project?\nWell, UX Aspects has many features that would prove to be advantageous to your project, be it big or small.\nWe bundle together numerous useful components that can form as the base of your project, and if you wish to use components that are responsive with a unique UX design you are in the right place.</p>\n<p>By just navigating through the Components section, you will undoubtedly come across features that will make you think &quot;If only I had seen this before!&quot;.\nLet&#x2019;s say you need a neat and tidy way of displaying a summary of user details for a list of users. In this case you could benefit from the Flippable Cards component which provides a way of displaying information without taking up unnecessary screen space. All you need to do is choose what you want the front and the back of your card to contain, and by hovering or clicking the card, you can see both sides.</p>\n<p>What if you need to provide some sort of notifications to users? This could be tricky and time consuming to implement yourself, but with UX Aspects we already have a solution for you. The Notifications component provides a method of displaying dismissible notifications on screen, with slick animations for when the notifications appear and disappear. You have many options to choose from to suit your needs. You can provide an icon for the notification, choose the duration for which notifications appear, display notifications as a badge etc.  </p>\n<p>Need a popup wizard to guide end users through a set of steps? No problem, why not implement the Marquee Wizard? With hooks to validation, you can provide your own validation methods to decide whether or not the user can continue to the next step. </p>\n<p>These are just a few of the components you can use to display information to end users in a seamless UX design. There are many more!</p>\n</body></html>"},LM6a:function(e,t){e.exports='<html><head></head><body><p>Angular makes the process of writing single page applications easy with a vast array of useful directives that often negate the need to write any JavaScript at all. However, when pages start to get complex and there are large amounts of data being shown, whether in table form or visually impressive charts, things can begin to slow down and it is often very easy to just blame the framework. While this could be the case, it is much more likely slow code in the application.</p>\n<p>Although modern machines often have impressive specs, JavaScript is largely single threaded (with the exception of WebWorkers) and with browsers running at 60 FPS, this gives us ~16ms to run any code in a given frame. On top of that the browser can take ~8ms of that time to calculate layout and render any changes, leaving us with approximately 8ms to work with. If we can&#x2019;t manage to do everything in that time frame the browser will start dropping frames which can result in a bad user experience.\nThere are certain things we can do to ensure Angular performs as quickly as it possibly can.</p>\n<h4 id="one-time-bindings">One Time Bindings</h4>\n<p>Any time we provide an Angular directive with a value, it can watch that value for any changes, which is great, as this provides us with a hassle free way to keep our model and view in sync. However in many occasions our data may be immutable, but Angular isn&#x2019;t aware of this and each time a digest cycle is run, Angular is checking to see if that value has changed when it really doesn&apos;t need to. As of Angular 1.3, we can now use one-time bindings, which will provide the directive with an initial value, but will not check again to see if it has changed. To use this feature simply add two colons before any value passed to a directive eg:</p>\n<pre class="hljs">&lt;p ng-bind=&quot;::vm.message&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</pre>\n<h4 id="avoid-interpolation">Avoid Interpolation</h4>\n<p>Angular provides us with a great way to add values from our controller or scope into the view through interpolation. An example of this could be:</p>\n<pre class="hljs">&lt;h1&gt;{{ vm.myHeading }}&lt;/h1&gt;</pre>\n<p>While very useful, and sometimes unavoidable, interpolation is slow and can often be improved by using <code>ng-bind</code> instead.</p>\n<h4 id="track-by">Track By</h4>\n<p>When using the <code>ng-repeat</code> directive consider adding a &#x201C;track by&#x201D; key. By adding this, any time the data changes it can determine which items where previously visible and will not create a new element for that item, reducing the amount of DOM manipulation occurring and can significantly reduce the amount of garbage collection the browser needs to do.</p>\n<pre class="hljs">&lt;tr ng-repeat=&quot;item in vm.items track by item.id&quot;&gt;</pre>\n<h4 id="-digest-vs-apply">$digest vs $apply</h4>\n<p>Most of the time any changes to data in the application will automatically be detected by Angular and the view will be updated, however there can be occasions where this won&apos;t happen automatically, such as when modifying data in a <code>setTimeout</code> callback. To manually inform Angular that there have been changes we can use <code>$scope.$apply()</code> or <code>$scope.$digest()</code>. Both of these may appear to do the same thing on the surface, but behind the scenes they are quite different and knowing when to use each one can bring quite a few performance benefits to your application.</p>\n<p><code>$scope.$digest()</code> will begin a digest cycle on the current scope, whereas <code>$scope.$apply()</code> is essentially an alias for <code>$rootScope.$digest()</code>. Once you realize this, you can see that <code>$scope.$digest()</code> will limit the dirty checking to the current scope only, reducing the number of checks significantly. Alternatively <code>$scope.$apply()</code> will check everything on the page, making it a much more expensive operation, so where possible it is always better to use <code>$digest</code> over <code>$apply</code>.</p>\n<h4 id="ng-show-vs-ng-if">ng-show vs ng-if</h4>\n<p>When it comes to showing and hiding DOM elements, Angular gives us two options in the form of <code>ng-if</code> and <code>ng-show</code> (or <code>ng-hide</code>). The <code>ng-show</code> directive will hide the element through styling, by setting <code>display</code> to <code>none</code>. The <code>ng-if</code> directive on the other hand will remove the element from the DOM entirely and as well as that will remove any watchers on the element and its children. Due to this fact it is often more performant to use <code>ng-if</code> where possible as this avoids performing updates on elements that are not visible to the user.</p>\n<h4 id="profiling">Profiling</h4>\n<p>Chrome Dev Tools provides excellent facilities to determine what parts of your code are running slowly.

Angular&apos;s router works extremely well with code splitting and can handle all the lazy loading for you.</p>\n<p>It is commonplace in JavaScript to use many libraries and frameworks in your application and the size of your bundle can grow quite quickly. It can be difficult to easily identify what your bundle actually contains and determine what libraries are increasing the output size.</p>\n<p>To help with this Webpack gives us a few useful tools. First we can output all the information about our Webpack build by passing the <code>--json</code> flag and streaming the output to a file. This can be done by using the following code:</p>\n<br>\n\n<pre class="hljs">webpack <span class="hljs-comment">--json &gt; stats.json</span></pre><br>\n\n\n<p>Next we can go to <a href="https://chrisbateman.github.io/webpack-visualizer/">https://chrisbateman.github.io/webpack-visualizer/</a> which is an online tool to visualize the contents of your bundle. Simply select the JSON file we just created and it will show you the contents of your bundle with more detail once you hover over a segment. <em>Note, if nothing happens when you choose the file, ensure that the stats.json file contains valid JSON as some loaders print output which can cause problems.</em></p>\n<br>\n\n<img src="'+n("szSE")+'">\n\n<br>\n\n<p>In the example image above you can see we have imported the entire RxJS library, adding 677.9KB to our build output.
