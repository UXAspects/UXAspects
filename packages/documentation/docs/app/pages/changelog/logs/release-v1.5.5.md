UX Aspects 1.5.5 is available! Check out the documentation at [https://uxaspects.github.io/UXAspects](https://uxaspects.github.io/UXAspects).

New Features:
* Many AngularJS components now have wrappers provided via Angular's new `UpgradeComponent` class, allowing easier integration into Angular applications. Look out for the documentation sections with the <span class="label label-accent">Angular Compatible</span> label in the header!

Bug Fixes:
* (EL-2988) [Wizard (Angular)](https://uxaspects.github.io/UXAspects/#/components/wizard#wizard) - added `stepChanging` event to assist with validation.
* (EL-2995) Reduction in bundle size to improve performance.
