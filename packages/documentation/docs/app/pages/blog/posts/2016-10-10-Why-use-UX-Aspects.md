You might be asking yourself, why should I use UX Aspects? How do I benefit from using UX Aspects in my project?
Well, UX Aspects has many features that would prove to be advantageous to your project, be it big or small.
We bundle together numerous useful components that can form as the base of your project, and if you wish to use components that are responsive with a unique UX design you are in the right place.

By just navigating through the Components section, you will undoubtedly come across features that will make you think "If only I had seen this before!".
Letâ€™s say you need a neat and tidy way of displaying a summary of user details for a list of users. In this case you could benefit from the Flippable Cards component which provides a way of displaying information without taking up unnecessary screen space. All you need to do is choose what you want the front and the back of your card to contain, and by hovering or clicking the card, you can see both sides.

What if you need to provide some sort of notifications to users? This could be tricky and time consuming to implement yourself, but with UX Aspects we already have a solution for you. The Notifications component provides a method of displaying dismissible notifications on screen, with slick animations for when the notifications appear and disappear. You have many options to choose from to suit your needs. You can provide an icon for the notification, choose the duration for which notifications appear, display notifications as a badge etc.  

Need a popup wizard to guide end users through a set of steps? No problem, why not implement the Marquee Wizard? With hooks to validation, you can provide your own validation methods to decide whether or not the user can continue to the next step. 

These are just a few of the components you can use to display information to end users in a seamless UX design. There are many more!
