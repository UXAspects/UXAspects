<p>The product name and logo should be positioned on the Standard Header above the page title. They should not be shown on the
    Condensed Header.</p>
<p>To include the product logo and name in a page, add the <code>.product-styling</code> class to
    the <code>div</code> element containing the product logo and name, and include this in the
    header markup. Within this, add the <code>.logo-styling</code> class for the logo, and the
    <code>.product-name</code> class for the name.</p>
<p>By default the product logo and name will be hidden when the side menu is closed, adding the <code>.always-visible</code>
    class along with the <code>.logo-styling</code> and <code>.product-name</code>
    classes will keep them visible after closing the side menu.</p>
