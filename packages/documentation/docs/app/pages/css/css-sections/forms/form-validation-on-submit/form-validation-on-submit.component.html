<p>The form demonstrated above can be used to validate each field when the user clicks the ‘Submit’ button. 
The user will be shown any affected fields with focus being on the first affected field.</p>

<p>If you wish you use a Form with Validation on submit, any <code>div</code> tag which contains an <code>input</code> that requires validation 
must implement the <code>form-group-validate-on-submit</code> class, rather than the ‘form-group-validate’ class used for field-by-field validation.</p>

<p>Inputs requiring validation must set the <code>ng-class</code> attribute, applying the <code>on-submit</code> class only when the form has been submitted i.e. <code>submitted=true</code>. 
<code>submitted</code> is only set to true when the ‘Submit’ button has been clicked, as seen in our HTML sample below.</p>

<p>When the submit button is initially clicked and there are fields with errors, it will be disabled until each field is corrected.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note</strong>: you must set the <code>ng-class</code> attribute and only apply the <code>disabled</code> class when the form has been submitted but still has errors (<code>$invalid</code>), for this to work correctly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>See the above documentation on field-by-field validation for information on how to show error text and error icons, 
however you must also add <code>submitted</code> to the <code>ng-show</code> expression to only show these when the form has been submitted.</p>

<p>Notice how the ‘Telephone’ input field involves setting a <code>pattern</code> attribute that makes the field invalid unless the user input follows that pattern.</p>

<p>The HTML code below shows how to implement the form used above:</p>

<tabset>
    <tab heading="HTML">
        <uxd-snippet [content]="snippets.compiled.sampleHtml"></uxd-snippet>
    </tab>
    <tab heading="JavaScript">
        <uxd-snippet language="javascript" [content]="snippets.compiled.sampleJs"></uxd-snippet>
    </tab>
</tabset>

<br>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note</strong>: if you wish to disable the default validation error text (which appears as a tooltip), 
you must give your form a unique ID as seen in the HTML sample above. You must then put the code seen in the Javascript tab into your controller, 
specifying the form ID as the <code>.element</code> parameter. We use a <code>$timeout</code> to ensure the page has fully loaded before executing the code.</p>
