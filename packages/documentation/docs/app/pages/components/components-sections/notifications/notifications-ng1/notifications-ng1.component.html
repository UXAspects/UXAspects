<p>Notifications can be used to inform the user of occurring events or to alert the user of something that may require their
  attention. Notifications will appear in the top right corner of the browser window and can be dismissed by the user by
  clicking the close button.</p>

<p>Notifications are controlled by the <code class="highlighter-rouge">notificationService</code> which can be injected into
  any controller in the application.</p>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">notificationService</code> has several functions available to control notifications.</p>

<uxd-api-properties>
    <tr uxd-api-property name="showNotification">
      This function should be called to show a notification. It should be given an object containing properties to configure
      the appearance and content of the notification. It will return the notification element (if notifications are visible
      - see <code>setNotificationVisibility</code>), this can be used to dismiss this individual notification at a later
      point.
    </tr>
    <tr uxd-api-property name="dismissNotification">
      This function can be called to dismiss a notification. It should be passed the notification element to dismiss.
    </tr>
    <tr uxd-api-property name="dismissAllNotifications">
      This function will return an array of all notifications shown since the browser was last refreshed. The objects in
      the array returned will contain the properties passed to the <code>showNotification</code> function along with
      an additional <code>date</code> property which will contain the time at which the notification was shown. If a
      more permanent history of notifications is required consider using local storage or a database.
    </tr>
    <tr uxd-api-property name="getNotifications">
      This function will dismiss any currently visible notifications.
    </tr>
    <tr uxd-api-property name="setNotificationVisibility">
      This function will determine whether notifications should be visibly displayed on screen when the <code>showNotification</code> function is called. If the <code>showNotification</code> function is called and the visibility is set to false,
      no notification will show, however a record of it will still be kept and can be accessed using the <code>getNotifications</code> function. This function expects a boolean value as an argument, a value of <code>true</code> will display notifications
      and a value of <code>false</code> will hide them. The default value is <code>true</code>.
    </tr>
    <tr uxd-api-property name="setDirection">
      This function allows you to set the order notifications are displayed. The two possible options are <code>append</code> (default) and <code>prepend</code>.
      When set to <code>append</code> new notifications will appear below older notifications. When set to <code>prepend</code> new notifications will appear above
      older notifications.
    </tr>
</uxd-api-properties>

<p>The following options can be used to configure the appearance and content of the notification:</p>

<uxd-api-properties>
    <tr uxd-api-property name="icon" type="string">
      	Sets the icon from the icon set to display within the notification.
    </tr>
    <tr uxd-api-property name="title" type="string">
      Sets the title displayed at the top of the notification.
    </tr>
    <tr uxd-api-property name="text" type="string">
      Sets the text displayed within the notification.
    </tr>
    <tr uxd-api-property name="subtitle" type="string">
      Sets the text displayed beneath the main notification text. This is useful for adding a timestamp to the notification.
    </tr>
    <tr uxd-api-property name="duration" type="number">
      Sets the duration (in milliseconds) the notification should appear before automatically dismissing. A value of <code>0</code> will show the notification until manually dismissed.
    </tr>
    <tr uxd-api-property name="backgroundColor" type="string">
      Sets the background color of the notification.
    </tr>
</uxd-api-properties>

<p>The HTML tab provides sample code to call the functions within the controller, while the Javascript tab provides an example
  of how the <code>notificationService</code> can be used to show or dismiss notifications.</p>
