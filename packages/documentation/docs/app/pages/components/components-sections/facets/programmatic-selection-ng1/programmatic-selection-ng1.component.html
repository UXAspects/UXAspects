<p>
    To enable programmatic selection of facets, pass an empty object to the <code>api</code> attribute of the <code>facet-container</code>    element. This object will be populated with a list of objects representing the facets in the container, allowing access
    to the <code>select</code> and <code>deselect</code> methods of their facet-options.
</p>

<p>
    This is compatible with standard Facets, Dynamic Facets, and Custom Facets. Note that when using Custom Facets, the value
    of the <code>model</code> needs to be changed independently of these functions.

        An example of the use of programmatic selection can be seen in the Filter Popover Controller in the 
        <a routerLink="/components/tables" fragment="detail-row-header-ng1">Detail Row Header</a> documentation.
