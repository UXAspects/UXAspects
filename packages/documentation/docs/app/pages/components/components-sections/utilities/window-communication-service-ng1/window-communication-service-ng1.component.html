<p>The <code>windowCommunicationService</code> can be used to easily and effectively share a scope between 2 separate windows
    with 2-way data communication being successfully achieved, which means that any changes made in the secondary window
    will update the original window, and vice versa. The service should be injected and has the following functions:</p>

<uxd-api-properties>
    <tr uxd-api-property name="createWindow">
        This is the main function that will be used. It allows the user to open a new window with the following parameters
        and returns the opened window as an object:
        <ul>
            <li><code>windowTitle</code> - (string), specifies the title of the window to be opened.</li>
            <li><code>scope</code> - (object), specifies the scope which is to be shared between the 2 windows.</li>
            <li><code>url</code> - (string), specifies the url of the window to be opened.</li>
            <li><code>winWidth</code> - (integer: optional), specifies the width of the window.</li>
            <li><code>winHeight</code> - (integer: optional), specifies the height of the window.</li>
            <li><code>winX</code> - (integer: optional), specifies the distance the window will be placed from the left
                of the screen.</li>
            <li><code>winY</code> - (integer: optional), specifies the distance the window will be placed from the top
                of the screen.</li>
            Note: If the user does not specify any of the optional parameters, the window will be approximately centered to the screen
            with the height being 400px less than the screen height and the width being 200px less than the screen
            width.
        </ul>
    </tr>
    <tr uxd-api-property name="updateContent">
        This method should be called when you wish to keep the current window open BUT change the url of the window (hence
        changing the content). This is useful if you don't want to have to close the window each time you change
        the window url (e.g. if you were navigating through a list of HTML templates). This function takes the 
        <code>scope</code> and <code>url</code> parameters described above.
