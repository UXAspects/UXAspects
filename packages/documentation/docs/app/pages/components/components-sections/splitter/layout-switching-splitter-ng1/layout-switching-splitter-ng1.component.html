<p>The example above demonstrates how to hide and show panels.</p>

<p>
    To hide a panel, place the attribute <code>splitter-panel-collapsed</code> on the <code>splitter-panel</code> element
    you wish to hide. To toggle between a shown and hidden state, add or remove the attribute as required and then
    reinitialize the Splitter. You can reinitialize the Splitter by passing an empty object to the <code>reinitialize</code>
    attribute on the <code>splitter</code> element (the container of the panel). This object will be overwritten with
    the reinitialization function, which can then be invoked from your own code at any time. Note that if you are using
    multiple nested Splitters you should obtain a reinitialize function reference for each of these individually.
