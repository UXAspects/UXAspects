UX Aspects 1.8.3 is available! Check out the documentation at [uxaspects.github.io/UXAspects](https://uxaspects.github.io/UXAspects).

#### New Features
* [Icon](https://uxaspects.github.io/UXAspects/#/components/icons#icon) - `ux-icon` has been implemented in all UX Aspects components, allowing substitution of glyphs that were previously not customizable.
* [Input Dropdown](https://uxaspects.github.io/UXAspects/#/components/input-controls#input-dropdown) - a new input control with a customizable dropdown.

#### Documentation
* (EL-3552) [Icon Set](https://uxaspects.github.io/UXAspects/#/css/icons#ux-icons) - a size selector has been added to preview the icons at larger sizes.
* (EL-3599) [Typeahead](https://uxaspects.github.io/UXAspects/#/components/input-controls#typeahead) - `ux-typeahead` now has its own section.

#### Bug Fixes and Improvements
* (EL-3615) [Radio Button](https://uxaspects.github.io/UXAspects/#/components/input-controls#radio-button) - added `uxRadioButtonGroup`, allowing groups of `ux-radio-button`s to be used in a reactive form.
* (EL-3616) [Tabs](https://uxaspects.github.io/UXAspects/#/components/tabs#tabs) - renamed `select` and `deselect` to `activated` and `deactivated` respectively, to avoid conflict with an existing HTML attribute.
