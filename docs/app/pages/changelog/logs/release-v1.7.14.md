#### New Features
* [Sankey Chart](https://uxaspects.github.io/UXAspects/#/charts/sankey-chart#sankey-chart)

#### Bug Fixes and Improvements
* (EL-3517) [Tabs](https://uxaspects.github.io/UXAspects/#/components/tabs#tabs) - new tabs can be added programmatically to the tabset in any position.
* (EL-3518) [Date Range Picker](https://uxaspects.github.io/UXAspects/#/components/date-time-picker#date-range-picker) - added `min` and `max` inputs, allowing the range of selectable dates to be restricted.
* (EL-3519) [Select](https://uxaspects.github.io/UXAspects/#/components/select#select) - paged data should now load correctly and without duplicate calls when the dropdown is opened.
* (EL-3520) [Search Builder (AngularJS)](https://uxaspects.github.io/UXAspects/#/components/search#search-builder-ng1) - added a `read-only` property to `search-group`, which removes the add and remove buttons from the group.
