#### Bug Fixes and Improvements
* (EL-3576) [Icons](https://uxaspects.github.io/UXAspects/#/css/icons#ux-icons) - `save`, `save-filled`, `news`, `news-aggregation`, `news-collection`, and `news-content` icons have been added.
* (EL-3584) [Fixed Header Table (AngularJS)](https://uxaspects.github.io/UXAspects/#/components/tables#fixed-header-table-ng1) - fixed an issue preventing paging when the table has a horizontal scrollbar.
* (EL-3586) [Select](https://uxaspects.github.io/UXAspects/#/components/select#select) - the new `clearButton` input can be used to display an "x" button in the component, which will remove the currently selected value(s).
* (EL-3587) [Date Range Picker](https://uxaspects.github.io/UXAspects/#/components/date-time-picker#date-range-picker) - fixed an issue where the "Today" button would not focus the current day if that day was already selected.
