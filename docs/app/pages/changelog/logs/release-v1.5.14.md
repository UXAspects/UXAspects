UX Aspects 1.5.14 is available! Check out the documentation at [https://uxaspects.github.io/UXAspects](https://uxaspects.github.io/UXAspects).

New Features:
* New substitutes for Bootstrap components, featuring improved accessibility (WCAG 2.0 AA level):
    * [Popover (Angular)](https://uxaspects.github.io/UXAspects/#/components/popover#popover)
    * [Tabs (Angular)](https://uxaspects.github.io/UXAspects/#/components/tabs#tabs)
    * [Tooltip (Angular)](https://uxaspects.github.io/UXAspects/#/components/tooltips#tooltips)

Bug Fixes:
* (EL-3156) [Select (Angular)](https://uxaspects.github.io/UXAspects/#/components/select#select) - clicking the typeahead scrollbar no longer causes the typeahead to close in Internet Explorer.
* (EL-3160) [Layout Switcher (Angular)](https://uxaspects.github.io/UXAspects/#/components/tables#layout-switching) - changing width now causes layouts to switch as intended.

**Note:** In an upcoming release, UX Aspects will gain support for [Angular 6](https://blog.angular.io/version-6-of-angular-now-available-cc56b0efa7a4). As part of this, we will have to drop support for Angular 4. If your application is currently using Angular 4, please review the [Angular Update Guide](https://update.angular.io/) and contact us with any questions. More information, including a target date for our Angular 6-compatible release, will become available in the coming weeks.
