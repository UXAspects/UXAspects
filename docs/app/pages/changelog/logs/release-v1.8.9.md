#### Bug Fixes and Improvements
* (EL-3657) [Facets (AngularJS)](https://uxaspects.github.io/UXAspects/#/components/facets#facets-ng1) - added `expanded` property to control the collapsed/expanded state of the facet.
* (EL-3673) [Fixed Header Table (AngularJS)](https://uxaspects.github.io/UXAspects/#/components/tables#fixed-header-table-ng1) - fixed an alignment issue when the table has scrollbars.
* (EL-3675) [Column Resizing](https://uxaspects.github.io/UXAspects/#/components/tables#column-resizing) - `uxResizableExpandingTable` implements a new resizing behavior which does not affect the width of other columns when resizing.
* [Search Builder (AngularJS)](https://uxaspects.github.io/UXAspects/#/components/search#search-builder-ng1) - `closePanel` can optionally take an array of objects, allowing more than one search component to be added at a time.
