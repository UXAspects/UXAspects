<img class="indicator-alt" [src]="progressGif" />

<hr>

<p>This has been offered as an alternative to the CSS only activity indicator.</p>

<p>
    The <code>img</code> tag is used to display the activity indicator. The default activity indicator is in the accent
    color, and is intended for use on a light background.
</p>

<p>
    An alternative activity indicator using the primary color has also been supplied, and is intended for use on a dark
    background.
</p>

<p>The activity indicators are supplied as <code>.svg</code> and <code>.gif</code> images.</p>

<p>
    There are large and small sizes available, which can be used in case of browser compatibility issues with the
    default indicators.
