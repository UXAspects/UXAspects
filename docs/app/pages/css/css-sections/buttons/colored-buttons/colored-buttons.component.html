<p>The Primary Button is a button with the primary brand color, and should be used with the default action in a page.</p>

<p>Button colors can be used to prompt the user as to the type of action which will be performed; for example the
<code>.button-warning</code> style can be used to warn a user about a potentially negative action.</p>

<p>The color of buttons will not be conveyed to users of assistive technologies such as screen readers.</p>

<p>If the button color is signifcant, a <code>.sr-only</code> tag should be added to describe this information.
This label will be available to assistive technologies, but it will not be visible in the page.</p>

<p>Buttons are <code>inline-block</code> level elements so whitespace in the HTML of the page is significant and will affect their layout.</p>
