<p>Bar charts and line charts can be extended to have scrolling capabilities for cases when the chart has to display large amounts of data.</p>

<p>To make a chart scrollable we need to define a <code>scrollable</code> object under the xaxis options.</p>

<uxd-api-properties>
    <tr uxdApiProperty name="scrollable" type="array">
      Helps configure the scrolling behavior.
    </tr>
</uxd-api-properties>

<hr>

<p>The following attributes should be defined within <code>scrollable</code></p>

<uxd-api-properties>
    <tr uxdApiProperty name="enabled" type="boolean">
      Set to true if scrolling will be enabled.
    </tr>
    <tr uxdApiProperty name="range" type="number">
      Represents the size of each page in relation to the points on the x-axis. For example, in the chart above a value of 4 will initially show any points between 0.5 and 4.5. When the next button is clicked it will show points between 4.5 and 8.5
    </tr>
    <tr uxdApiProperty name="lowerBound" type="number">
      Represents the minimum point on the x-axis that can be scrolled to. Once the chart is at this position the scroll left button will be hidden.
    </tr>
    <tr uxdApiProperty name="upperBound" type="number">
      Represents the maximum point on the x-axis that can be scrolled to. Once the chart is at this point the scroll right button will be hidden.
    </tr>
    <tr uxdApiProperty name="color" type="color">
      Sets the color of the scroll buttons.
    </tr>
    <tr uxdApiProperty name="callback" type="function">
      Will be called when the chart is scrolled. It should take in one parameter that will contain two properties.
    </tr>
</uxd-api-properties>

<hr>

<p>The following attributes should be defined within <code>callback</code></p>

<uxd-api-properties>
    <tr uxdApiProperty name="start" type="number">
      Contains the minimum value on the x-axis that is currently visible.
    </tr>
    <tr uxdApiProperty name="end" type="number">
      Contains the maximum value on the x-axis that is currently visible.
    </tr>
</uxd-api-properties>
