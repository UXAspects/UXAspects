<p>Hotkeys in UX Aspects can be configured in a number of ways. The above example shows two default behaviours - on the left,
  the hotkey tabs between each item in the group, including the group itself. In this case the user can ‘press’ the button
  using the spacebar or associated default keybinding for the control - this will be unchanged.</p>

<p>In the example on the right, the hotkey tabs between each item in the group and also immediately invokes the behaviour associated
  with that button.</p>

<p>Both groups display the ‘hotkey hint’ in their upper-left corner. This can be used to inform the user of available keys and
  is optional.</p>

<p>In order to create a group of hotkeys, use the <code>hotkey</code> directive. This is an attribute directive so should be
  placed as an attribute on another element. The value set to this attribute should be the key you want to bind your hotkey
  functionality to. If you are making a group of items, this attribute should be placed on the outermost container. To associate
  child elements as being part of that hotkey group, give them the <code>hotkey-item</code> attribute.</p>

<p>The container element can take two additional attribute parameters:</p>
<div class="demo-attributes table-responsive">
  <table class="table m-t">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Type</th>
        <th>Binding</th>
        <th>Description</th>
        <th>Optional</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="attribute">hotkey-action</td>
        <td>function</td>
        <td>variable</td>
        <td>A function which will be called every time your hotkey is pressed, in addition to the tabbing/focusing logic. This
          function is called with the focused element as an argument, so you can configure different behaviour for each child
          element.
        </td>
        <td>true</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="attribute">hotkey-hint</td>
        <td>boolean</td>
        <td>literal</td>
        <td>This attribute will place the hotkey hint graphic in the top-left corner.</td>
        <td>true</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>
<p>When using the <code>hotkey-hint</code>, the precise styling can be controlled using the
  <code>hotkey-group-hint</code> class. This class exists in Elements and will show a hotkey hint in the style shown in this
  page. To customise the appearance of the hotkey hint, you can override this class with your own values. As an example of
  this - on this page, the default styling has been extended to provide a top and left margin of <code>-2px</code> on the
  hotkey hint, because the example button panels above use a <code>2px</code> width border and we want them to appear flush.
  This also allows you to change the appearance of the hotkey hint depending on the component. For example, the demo above
  is wrapped with a
  <code>hotkey-demo-only</code> class, so defining a CSS class <code>.hotkey-demo-only .hotkey-group-hint</code> allows us
  to override the CSS for just this instance.</p>

<h4>Hotkey Action</h4>

<p>This directive will allow your users to focus a set of controls using the keyboard and navigate around them using the same
  key. Each time that key is pressed, the function you have supplied to the <code>hotkey-action</code> attribute will be
  invoked. This function will be called with the highlighted element as the argument. This allows your callback to check
  which item the user currently has selected, and perform logic accordingly. For instance, if you want the hotkey to also
  trigger the “click” event of that button as if the user had clicked it, your code might look like this:</p>

<uxd-snippet [content]="snippets.compiled.callbackJs" language="javascript"></uxd-snippet>

<h4>Usage Notes</h4>

<p>This example uses some styles which are purely for illustrative purposes; however the ‘focus’ style is important to provide.
  Elements supplies the <code>aspects-outline</code> class which you may place on your container element; this will apply
  the same ‘focus’ style as other controls in Elements. If required you may write your own class to change the styling of
  your element using the <code>:focus</code> CSS pseudo-selector.</p>

<p>In order to allow the elements within your hotkey group to receive keyboard focus, the directive will assign them a
  <code>tabindex</code> if one is not already present. This is related to expected browser behaviour and is not a requirement
  of Elements itself.</p>

<p>Hotkeys created by this directive will be bound to the <code>document</code> node; this means they should trigger when the
  key is pressed anywhere on your page. The exception to this is <code>input</code>,
  <code>textarea</code>, <code>select</code> and <code>contenteditable</code> elements, which will <em>not</em> invoke hotkeys
  (so that the user can type). If you wish to disable hotkey triggering on additional elements, add the <code>hotkey-ignore</code>  attribute to that element. Hotkey events will no longer trigger when that event is focused.</p>

<p>Hotkeys created by this directive will be deleted when the element is destroyed. In practical terms this means that users
  navigating to other pages of your application will not continue to have unwanted hotkey events - however the developer
  is responsible for ensuring their application is structured as per Angular recommendations so that the <code>$destroy</code>  event for each element <code>$scope</code> is guaranteed to execute: refer to the <a href="https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/type/$rootScope.Scope#$destroy">Angular JS $scope documentation</a>  for more details.</p>

<p>See below for information on manually unbinding hotkeys and having hotkeys which exist across an entire application.</p>

<h4>Sample Code</h4>

<p>The sample code for both examples above is presented below. Note that the example-specific styling has been removed for the
  sake of clarity.</p>
