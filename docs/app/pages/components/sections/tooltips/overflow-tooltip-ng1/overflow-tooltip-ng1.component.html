<p>The <code>overflow-tooltip</code> directive can be used to truncate text which may overflow its container, replacing the
    overflow with an ellipsis. It is particularly suited for multi-line text where the ellipsis should come on the final
    line. The text will always be truncated at the last full word, unless the text is a single word or the text has no spaces,
    in which case words may be truncated between letters. The truncation position will be updated when the container resizes
    or when the text content changes, and the tooltip will only be shown if the text has been truncated.</p>

<p>The contents of the element to which this directive are applied can also contain HTML in addition to plain text, allowing
    complex formatting to be retained. The <code>overflow-tooltip</code> directive is compatible with the <code>tooltip-placement</code>    attribute described above.</p>
