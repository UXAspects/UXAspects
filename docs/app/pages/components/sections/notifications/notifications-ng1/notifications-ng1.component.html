<p>Notifications can be used to inform the user of occurring events or to alert the user of something that may require their
  attention. Notifications will appear in the top right corner of the browser window and can be dismissed by the user by
  clicking the close button.</p>

<p>Notifications are controlled by the <code class="highlighter-rouge">notificationService</code> which can be injected into
  any controller in the application.</p>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">notificationService</code> has several functions available to control notifications.</p>
<div class="demo-attributes table-responsive">
  <table class="table">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th>Property</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="attribute">showNotification</td>
        <td>This function should be called to show a notification. It should be given an object containing properties to configure
          the appearance and content of the notification. It will return the notification element (if notifications are visible
          - see <code>setNotificationVisibility</code>), this can be used to dismiss this individual notification at a later
          point.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="attribute">dismissNotification</td>
        <td>This function can be called to dismiss a notification. It should be passed the notification element to dismiss.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="attribute">dismissAllNotifications</td>
        <td>This function will dismiss any currently visible notifications.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="attribute">getNotifications</td>
        <td>this function will return an array of all notifications shown since the browser was last refreshed. The objects in
          the array returned will contain the properties passed to the <code>showNotification</code> function along with
          an additional <code>date</code> property which will contain the time at which the notification was shown. If a
          more permanent history of notifications is required consider using local storage or a database.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="attribute">setNotificationVisibility</td>
        <td>This function will determine whether notifications should be visibly displayed on screen when the <code>showNotification</code> function is called. If the <code>showNotification</code> function is called and the visibility is set to false,
          no notification will show, however a record of it will still be kept and can be accessed using the <code>getNotifications</code> function. This function expects a boolean value as an argument, a value of <code>true</code> will display notifications
          and a value of <code>false</code> will hide them. The default value is <code>true</code>.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>
<p>The following options can be used to configure the appearance and content of the notification:</p>
<div class="demo-attributes table-responsive">
  <table class="table m-t">
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <th>Name</th>
        <th>Type</th>

      <tr>
        <td class="attribute">icon</td>
        <td>string</td>
        <td>Sets the icon from the icon set to display within the notification.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="attribute">title</td>
        <td>string</td>

      <tr>
        <td class="attribute">subtitle</td>
        <td>string</td>
        <td>Sets the text displayed beneath the main notification text. This is useful for adding a timestamp to the notification.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="attribute">duration</td>
        <td>number</td>
        <td>Sets the duration (in milliseconds) the notification should appear before automatically dismissing. A value of <code>0</code> will show the notification until manually dismissed.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td class="attribute">backgroundColor</td>
        <td>string</td>
        <td>Sets the background color of the notification.</td>
      </tr>

<p>The HTML tab provides sample code to call the functions within the controller, while the Javascript tab provides an example
  of how the <code>notificationService</code> can be used to show or dismiss notifications.</p>
