<p>The <code>timeAgoService</code> can be used to generate a string reflecting the duration between two specific points in time.
    The service should be injected into the controller and has the following functions:</p>

<div class="demo-attributes table-responsive">
    <table class="table m-t">
        <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="attribute">setStrings</td>
            <td>This can be used to localize or customize the strings that are generated. The function expects an object which
                contains strings for each time period. See below for the default options.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="attribute">timeSinceNow</td>
            <td>This function will generate a string based on the current date and time. It expects one argument which should
                be a date object representing a date and time that has already passed.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="attribute">timeSince</td>
            <td>Similar to the <code>timeSinceNow</code> function, however it expects a second argument which will be the date
                and time you wish to assume as 'the present'. The string returned will reflect the time that has passed since
                this date.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</div>

<p>Below is an example of how the <code>timeAgoService</code> can be used in a controller:</p>

<uxd-snippet language="javascript" [code]="snippet1"></uxd-snippet>

<h4>Default Strings</h4>

<p>The following object shows the default set of strings that will be returned by the service. Pass a similar object to the
    <code>setStrings</code> method to customize and of the string values. Strings that can have varying units should use
    <code><span class="p">{{</span><span class="err">x</span><span class="p">}}</span></code> to represent where the unit should
    be placed.</p>

<uxd-snippet language="javascript" [code]="snippet2"></uxd-snippet>

<p>Additionally, a <code>time-ago</code> directive is available for text elements that will update in real time to reflect the
    length of time since a specific date/time. See the following example:</p>

<uxd-time-ago-service-wrapper></uxd-time-ago-service-wrapper>

<p>The <code>time-ago</code> directive should be used as an attribute with a value that binds to a date object in the controller.
    The string produced will represent how long ago the date specified is from the present time.</p>
