<h3 class="m-t-sm m-b-md">HTML</h3>

<p>The Search Builder modal template follows the basic layout explained on the documentation page. The <code>search-builder</code>
    directive has been added and the <code>search-groups</code> directives have been added as child elements.</p>

<p>A <code>modal-inset-panel</code> has also been added to the main body of the modal. Note that all the <code>modal-inset-panel</code>
    bindings point to a service. This is because we want some of the <code>search-components</code> to be able to open and
    display content in the panel and separating it out into its own service makes this much easier. This is explained in
    greater detail in the <b>services</b> section.</p>

<p>The last addition feature that has been added to the modal is spark chart which is used to show how many search results the
    user can expect to get with the current query.</p>

<p>The following HTML was used as the modal template:</p>

<pre class="language-html"><code ng-bind="snippets.compiled.modalLayoutHtml"></code></pre>

<h3 class="m-b-md">Controller</h3>

<p>The modal controller plays an important role in tying all the features together. Some of the items being injected into the
    controller may not be familiar:
    <ul>
        <li><code>searchBuilderPanel</code> - this is a service that will be created to manage the modal inset panel and its
            content (see <b>services</b> section).</li>
        <li><code>searchBuilderId</code> - this is a service that will be created to provide unique ids for the <code>search-components</code>
            (see <b>services</b> section).</li>
        <li><code>searchQuery</code> - this allows the controller launching the modal to pass in an initial search query.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>The controller also configures several of the controls within the modal such as the scrollbar, the spark chart and the <code>search-builder</code>,
    most importantly registering all the <code>search-components</code> that are available to the <code>search-builder</code>.</p>

<p>The controller has two important functions which allow adding new fields to a <code>search-group</code>. The first is <code>vm.addKeywordField</code>
    which will always return a <code>keyword</code> component. This is the simplest way to add a new field, however the desired
    action may be to allow the user to choose the type of field they want to add in which case we cannot immediately return
    the type of the component. The <code>vm.addCustomField</code> is an example of how to allow the user to choose a specific
    type of field. Using the <code>searchBuilderPanel</code> service it opens the inset panel by calling the <code>openPanel</code>
    function. This function returns a <code>$q.defer().promise</code> which will add the field when the promise is resolved.
    It is now up to the panel to resolve or reject this once the field is known or the panel is dismissed.</p>

<p>The following code is used for the modal controller: </p>

<pre class="language-javascript"><code ng-bind="snippets.compiled.modalControllerJs"></code></pre>

<i>Note. This controller generates fake search result counts when the search query is changed based on the number of terms being searched for.</i>

<h3 class="m-b-md">CSS</h3>
<p>The following CSS was used to produce the styling in the example.</p>
