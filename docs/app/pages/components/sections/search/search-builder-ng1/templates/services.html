<h3 class="m-t-sm m-b-md">SearchBuilderPanel Service</h3>

<p>The first service to create is the <code>searchBuilderPanel</code> service. The purpose of this service is to manage all
  the properties of the <code>modal-inset-panel</code> from one place. This is particularly useful in this modal as some
  of the <code>search-components</code> should also be able to open the panel and display content in them. As this is all
  handled in a service it can simply be injected into any component that wants to control the panel.</p>

<p>The following code is used to create the service:</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code ng-bind="snippets.compiled.searchBuilderPanelServiceJs"></code></pre>

<h3 class="m-b-md">SearchBuilderId Service</h3>

<p>The second service to create is the <code>searchBuilderId</code> service. The purpose of this service is to ensure each component
  gets a unique id.</p>

<p>The following code is used to create the service:</p>

<pre class="language-javascript"><code ng-bind="snippets.compiled.searchBuilderIdServiceJs"></code></pre>
