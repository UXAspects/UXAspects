<p>When displaying long lists of data it is often preferable to add paging to the list. By using paging data is loaded in small
  blocks improving load times and reducing the workload on the server providing the data.</p>

<p>To implement paging functionality add the <code>infinite-scroll</code> directive as an attribute to the element that has
  the scrollbar. This will also work on elements using the <em>custom scrollbar</em>.</p>

<p>There are several other attributes that can be added to configure the behavior:</p>

          first will be the number representing which page to load, the second will be the number of items expected to be
          in each page and the third will be the search query if one was specified. This function should either return an
          array containing the data for the associated page, or a <code>$q.defer().promise</code> if data is not immediately
          available.</td>

              More').</li>
            <li><code>class</code> - string (optional), if set this will allow additional CSS classes to be added to the button
              which can be used to change the buttons appearance (default: none).</li>
