<p>A flot chart can be manipulated by other controls as seen in the example above which uses a facet to change the dataset displayed and another facet to change the date range.</p>

<p>When the date range is changed the chart will only show points on the chart that fall between those dates. It will also recalculate the ticks on the Y axis to show a more appropriate scale based on the visible points. This may also be desired when using a Timeline Chart. In the sample code below the function <code>updateChartYAxis</code> is responsible for calculating a new Y axis scale. This function should be used as a basis to provide such functionality for any chart that needs to rescale its Y axis.</p>
