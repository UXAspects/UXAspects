    The EBox panel is used throughout our documentation to contain our examples and code snippets. The surrounding panel of this
    example is an EBox panel. To create an EBox you can use the <code>ux-ebox</code> component.
</p>

<p>
    Within this component you should have two child components, the <code>ux-ebox-header</code> component and the <code>ux-ebox-content</code> component. 
    Inside these you can insert HTML to be displayed in that region of the EBox component.
</p>

<p>You can create an ebox using the following code:</p>

<uxd-snippet language="html" [content]="snippets.compiled.appHtml"></uxd-snippet>
