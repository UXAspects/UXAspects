    The Preview Pane Window allows you to open a separate window for the currently displayed file. This is especially useful
    when using dual monitors allowing a larger preview window to be viewed on a second monitor.
</p>

<p>
    You can have a list of files and when traversing through the list with the Preview Pane Window open, you can see the page
    updating to display the correct file.
</p>

<p>
    A very interesting feature of the Preview Pane Window is that when you are displaying the preview in a separate window, any
    changes made in the secondary window will update the original window, and vice versa. This means you can see your changes
    happening live and don’t have to worry about writing complex code to keep the 2 windows in sync (2 way communication
    between the windows achieved).
</p>

<p>
    You can see this in our example above by navigating to any <code>.html</code> file (e.g.
    <code>Document 1.html</code>) and clicking the “Standalone Viewer” button above the Preview Pane area ( <i class="hpe-icon hpe-clone"></i> ). 
    Enter text into the “Signed” input field and you will see the Preview Pane Window updating as you type, and vice versa
    if you make changes in the Preview Pane Window.
</p>

<p>
    In order to implement the Preview Pane Window, you must use the <code>preview-pane-window</code> directive and give it
    a unique <code>preview-name</code> attribute. This will insert the “Standalone Viewer” button which the user can click
    to open the Preview Pane Window. The <code>preview-pane</code> directive must also have a <code>preview-name</code> attribute
    set which will be the same value as the attribute you set in the <code>preview-pane-window</code> directive.

<p>You can see the code used in our example above by selecting the appropriate tabs below:</p>

<tabset>
    <tab heading="HTML">
        <uxd-snippet language="html" [code]="htmlCode"></uxd-snippet>
    </tab>
    
    <tab heading="Javascript">
        <uxd-snippet language="javascript" [code]="jsCode"></uxd-snippet>
    </tab>
    
    <tab heading="CSS">
        <uxd-snippet language="css" [code]="cssCode"></uxd-snippet>
    </tab>
</tabset>

<p>
    The preview pane window has the class <code>.preview-pane-window-contents</code> class which can be used to style things
    different when they are within the window. One use for this is to hide the footer when in the preview pane but make it
    visible when in the window. An example of a preview pane footer can be found below:
