<p>
    As an alternative to using checkboxes for multiple selection, if the preview pane is not required then the grid may be configured
    to select by clicking/shift-clicking on the rows themselves. In this mode, clicking begins a new selection, and shift-clicking
    adds further items to the selection. The <code>multiple-row-select-item="item"</code> attribute on the table row
    enables this, specifying the item to select.

<p>
    To enable keyboard navigation without the presence of the preview pane, the <code>keyboard-navigable-table</code> attribute
    may be attached to the <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> element. Then, when the table has focus, the up and down arrows will
    move the highlighted row up and down the table. The left and right arrow keys will move focus between the hover buttons
    on the row, if any are present, and the enter key will activate the focused button. Finally, the space key will toggle
    the selected state for the highlighted row.
