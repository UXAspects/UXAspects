<p>When displaying long lists of data it is often preferable to add paging to the list. By using paging data is loaded in small
  blocks improving load times and reducing the workload on the server providing the data.</p>

<p>To implement paging functionality add the <code>infinite-scroll</code> directive as an attribute to the element that has
  the scrollbar. This will also work on elements using the <em>custom scrollbar</em>.</p>

<p>There are several other attributes that can be added to configure the behavior:</p>

<uxd-api-properties>
    <tr uxd-api-property name="page-size" type="number" binding="variable" required="true">
      This should inform the directive of the number of items each page will contain. If a page contains less than the specified number of items then it will be assumed that it is the last page and no more should be loaded.
    </tr>
    <tr uxd-api-property name="page-fn" type="boolean" binding="variable" required="true">
      This function will be called when a page of data is required. The function will be called with three arguments, the
      first will be the number representing which page to load, the second will be the number of items expected to be
      in each page and the third will be the search query if one was specified. This function should either return an
      array containing the data for the associated page, or a <code>$q.defer().promise</code> if data is not immediately
      available.
    </tr>
    <tr uxd-api-property name="page-position" type="number" binding="variable">
      Represents the point at which the next page should be loaded. This number is a represents a percentage so the value should be between 1 - 100. The default behavior will attempt to load the next page when the scroll handle reaches 85% of the way down the track.
    </tr>
    <tr uxd-api-property name="item-template" type="string" binding="variable" required="true">
      The url of the template for each item in the list. Each item in the list will have the same template, when an item
      is added to the list it is created with a scope containing a <code>data</code> property that holds the data associated
      with that item.
    </tr>
    <tr uxd-api-property name="container-id" type="string" binding="variable">
      If the list items should be added to a different element than the one this directive is added to, this should be
      used to identify the element. This should be used with the <code>infinite-scroll-container</code> directive, see
      example code for more information. This is particularly useful when using a infinite scrolling with custom scrollbars.
    </tr>
    <tr uxd-api-property name="show-loading" type="boolean" binding="variable" defaultValue="true">
      This specifies whether or not a loading indicator should be shown when a page is loading.
    </tr>
    <tr uxd-api-property name="search-query" type="string" binding="variable">
      If specified when this query changes, the list will be cleared and the page function will be called to return results relevant to the search query.
    </tr>
    <tr uxd-api-property name="window-scroll" type="boolean" binding="variable">
      If set to true the <code>page-fn</code> will be called when the browser window is scrolled to the <code>page-position</code>
      rather than binding to the scroll event of the element the directive is on.
    </tr>
    <tr uxd-api-property name="load-more-button" type="object" binding="variable">
      If specified this can be used to enable and configure a button to appear at the bottom of the list. Clicking this
      button will load the next page of items rather than scrolling near the bottom. The following options can be used
      to configure the button:
      <ul>
        <li><code>show</code> - boolean (optional), if set to true a button will be added to the bottom of the list and will
          be used to load the next page (default: false).</li>
        <li><code>text</code> - string (optional), if set this will change the text displayed in the button (default: 'Load
          More').</li>
        <li><code>class</code> - string (optional), if set this will allow additional CSS classes to be added to the button
          which can be used to change the buttons appearance (default: none).</li>
      </ul>
    </tr>
</uxd-api-properties>

<p>Additionally, there are several events which can be broadcast to allow further interaction with the directive.</p>

<uxd-api-properties>
  <tr uxd-api-property name="infiniteScroll.reset" type="void">
    This will reset the infinite scroll directive. It will clear all items and start loading the first page.
  </tr>
  <tr uxd-api-property name="infiniteScroll.reload" type="void">
    This will call the paging function for each loaded page and update any changed data. The current page and scroll position will be retained.
  </tr>
  <tr uxd-api-property name="infiniteScroll.reloadPage" type="number">
    This will call the paging function for the specified page. It will then update the data for that page while retaining scroll position.
  </tr>
</uxd-api-properties>
