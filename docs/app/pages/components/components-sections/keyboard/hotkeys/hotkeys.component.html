<hr>

<p>Hotkeys can be added to elements by adding <code>window:keydown</code> to the host property of your component.
    This will trigger the specified function any time a key is pressed on the window offering a wide range of uses. </p>

<p>The above example shows two different example behaviours - on the left, the hotkey tabs between each item in the group, including
    the group itself. In this case the user can ‘press’ the button using the spacebar or associated default keybinding for
    the control - this will be unchanged.</p>

<p>In the example on the right, the hotkey tabs between each item in the group and also immediately invokes the behavior associated
    with that button.</p>

<p>Both groups display the ‘hotkey hint’ in their upper-left corner. This can be used to inform the user of available keys and
    is optional.</p>

<p>When using the <code>hotkey-hint</code>, the precise styling can be controlled using the <code>hotkey-group-hint</code> class.
    This class exists in UX Aspects and will show a hotkey hint in the style shown in this page. To customize the appearance
    of the hotkey hint, you can override this class with your own values. As an example of this - on this page, the default
    styling has been extended to provide a top and left margin of <code>-2px</code> on the hotkey hint, because the example
    button panels above use a <code>2px</code> width border and we want them to appear flush. This also allows you to change
    the appearance of the hotkey hint depending on the component. For example, the demo above is wrapped with a <code>hotkey-demo-hint</code>    class, so defining a CSS class <code>.hotkey-demo-hint
    .hotkey-group-hint</code> allows us to override the CSS for just this instance.</p>

<h4>Usage Notes</h4>

<p>This example uses some styles which are purely for illustrative purposes; however the ‘focus’ style is important to provide.
    UX Aspects supplies the <code>aspects-focus-outline</code> class which you may place on your container element; this
    will apply the same ‘focus’ style as other controls in UX Aspects. If required you may write your own class to change
    the styling of your element using the <code>:focus</code> CSS pseudo-selector.</p>

<p>The above example was was produced using the following code:</p>

<ux-tabset [minimal]="false">
    <ux-tab heading="HTML">
        <uxd-snippet [content]="snippets.compiled.appHtml" language="html"></uxd-snippet>
    </ux-tab>
    <ux-tab heading="TypeScript">
        <uxd-snippet [content]="snippets.compiled.appTs" language="javascript"></uxd-snippet>
    </ux-tab>
</ux-tabset>
