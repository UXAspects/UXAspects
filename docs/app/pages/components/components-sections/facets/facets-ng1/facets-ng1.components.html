<p>
    Facets are contained inside a <code>facet-container</code> element. A <code>facet-container</code> element can have many
    <code>facet</code> elements underneath it. The <code>facet-container</code> must have the <code>select-title</code> and
    <code>clear-text</code> attributes set. <code>select-title</code> should be set to the value which appears above the
    selected facets. <code>clear-text</code> should be set to the value which appears in the clear all link. In addition
    to these options the <code>no-items-text</code> attribute can be set which will display the specified text when no facet
    options have been selected. <code>no-items-text</code> is an optional attribute.
</p>

<p>
    The <code>clear-all-fn</code> is an optional attribute in this directive that defines a function expression called when
    the clearAll is clicked. This option will override the default function expression provided in UX Aspects and can be used
    to define a user method.

<p>A <code>facet</code> element may have the following attributes:</p>

<uxd-api-properties>
    <tr uxdApiProperty name="name" type="string" binding="variable" required="true">
        The facet title.
    </tr>
    <tr uxdApiProperty name="facet-scroll" type="string" binding="literal" defaultValue="on">

    A <code>facet</code> element can contain many <code>facet-option</code> elements. <code>facet-option</code> elements
    can have the following attributes:
</p>

<uxd-api-properties>
    <tr uxdApiProperty name="name" type="string" binding="variable" required="true">
        A bindable property which will be displayed as the option.
    </tr>
    <tr uxdApiProperty name="count" type="number" binding="variable">
        An optional bindable property which will appear alongside the name in braces. Note that the count should update as facets are applied.
    </tr>
    <tr uxdApiProperty name="select" type="function" binding="variable" required="true">
        A function expression which will be called when the option is selected. This function should perform any 
        filtering that is required and update counts as necessary. The select count should update as facets are applied, 
        based on the number of items selected which will be displayed on the toolbar in selection mode.
    </tr>
    <tr uxdApiProperty name="deselect" type="function" binding="variable" required="true">
        a function expression which will be called when the option is deselected. This function should 
        perform any filtering that is required and update counts as necessary. The select count should 
        update as facets are applied, based on the number of items selected which will be displayed on the 
        toolbar in selection mode.
    </tr>
    <tr uxdApiProperty name="load-delay" type="number" binding="variable" required="true">
        An optional property to specify a delay in milliseconds to load the facets.

        A property which accepts a string used in assistive technologies to indicate whether the facet option is selected.

        Setting this to false will use the standard checkbox style.

    <tr uxdApiProperty name="updateSelectCounts">
        A function expression which will be called when facet option is selected (<code>select</code>) or

<p>
    If the visibility of the facet container can be toggled, then the <code>facet-reinitialise</code> event may be broadcast
    by the controller in order to prevent display issues with the facet options when they become visible. For example, if
    visibility of the facets is controlled by a boolean variable, the following code will broadcast the event at the appropriate
    time.
