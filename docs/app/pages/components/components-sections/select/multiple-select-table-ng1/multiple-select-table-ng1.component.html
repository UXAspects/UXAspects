<p>The Multiple Select Table can be used for selecting multiple items in a table format. As with the Single Select Table described
    above, it also makes use of the <code>select-table</code> component. The only additional feature is the <code>multiple-select</code>
    attribute which is used solely for selecting multiple items. All other attributes for the <code>select-table</code> maintain
    the same functionality with the exception of the following:</p>

<uxd-api-properties>
    <tr uxdApiProperty name="multiple-select" type="boolean" binding="literal">
        Allows selection of multiple items. If set to <code>true</code> the user will be able to select and deselect multiple
        items.
    </tr>
    <tr uxdApiProperty name="selected" type="array" binding="variable" required="true">
        This should be set as an array for the Multiple Select Table as there can be multiple selected values, whereas the
        Single Select Table only takes one selected value. It can be an array of strings or an array of objects. If it
        is an array of objects, the <code>select-key</code> attribute (as described in the Single Select Table) should
        be set to the name of the key, whose value from the object will be displayed. For example, if you have an object
        like: <code>{{codeSnippet}}</code> and you want the name to be displayed, you would set <code>select-key="name"</code>.
    </tr>
    <tr uxdApiProperty name="select-hidden-items" type="string" binding="variable">
        This attribute is not used in the Multiple Select Table.
    </tr>
</uxd-api-properties>
