    These are actions that can be performed against a single item in a <code>table</code>. There should never be more than
    3 of these actions and they should be restricted to the most common actions a user would want to perform.

    To create these actions add the <code>.item-actions</code> class to the last <code>td</code> in each <code>tr</code>.
    Inside the <code>td.item-actions</code> add an <code>item-hover-actions</code> element which will contain the <code>item-hover-action</code> elements. The <code>item-hover-action</code> can have the following attributes:
