<p>
    Some controls can require <code>index</code> and <code>tabIndex</code> attributes to be set. To avoid having
    to calculate these manually you can use the <code>auto-index</code> directive. This directive is an attribute directive
    that can be placed on any item which will be iterated using an
    <code>ng-repeat</code> statement. Although it can be used in other cases it is intended for use with Table controls.
</p>

<p>For example, refer to the following sample code showing how the attribute might be placed on a table row:</p>

<uxd-snippet language="html" [content]="htmlCode"></uxd-snippet>

<p>This example would give each row the indices 0, 4, 8, 12… respectively. This allows for each row to contain indices for additional items, as shown:</p>

<p><img src="../../../../../assets/img/indexExample.png" class="img img-responsive"></p>

<p>
    These additional indices would either be configured manually, or will be provided if using this in conjunction with a
    Preview Pane or Item Display Panel. The <code>tabindex</code> value will be set either to 1 or -1; as it is anticipated
    that a control providing direct keyboard control will be used in conjunction, requiring the default tabbing behaviour
    to be overriden with programatic keyboard control.
</p>

<p>The full set of configuration options for this directive are as follows:</p>

<div class="demo-attributes table-responsive">
    <table class="table m-t">
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <th>Name</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="attribute">skip</td>
                <td>A count of how many additional items are in the row and will need an index value (default: 0).</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="attribute">offset</td>
                <td>A constant offset to apply to each calculated index (default: 0).</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="attribute">base</td>
                <td>The lowest index value (default: 0).</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
</div>

<p>
    If no values are provided then each item subject to the <code>ng-repeat</code> would receive an index value <em>0, 1, 2, 3 …</em>.
