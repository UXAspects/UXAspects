<p>
    When there are a large number of filter options, the Dynamic Filter can be used to replace the regular dropdown with a text
    search, supporting dropdown typeahead. This is configurable to fallback to the standard implementation when the list
    of filters falls beneath a certain length.
</p>

<p>
    To use the Dynamic Filter, set a <code>filter</code> directive, but no Filter Options inside
    it. Instead, set <code>filter-options</code> as an <em>attribute</em> on the <code>filter</code>,
    and bind this to the list of filter options. The objects of this list should define the same properties as the Filter
    Option described above.
</p>

<p>
    Additionally, set the <code>display-configuration</code> attribute, which expects an object
    of the following format:
</p>

<div class="demo-attributes table-responsive">
    <table class="table">
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <th>Property</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="attribute">minCharacters</td>
                <td>How many characters should be typed before a dropdown is shown (default: 3).</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="attribute">maxDisplayableItems</td>
                <td>How many entries to show in the typeahead dropdown (default: show all matches).</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td class="attribute">maxIndividualItems</td>
                <td>When there are fewer than this many items, a list of Filter Options will be shown instead of a text input
                    (default: 0).</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
</div>

<p>
    The values presented in the dropdown can also be changed dynamically. This is optional behaviour, but useful if you wish
    to perform additional server requests on demand. The function supplied to <code>update-callback</code> will be triggered
    every time the contents of the text input are modified. The function will be called with:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>textInput</code> - the text value in the search control.</li>
    <li><code>optionList</code> - the array of options the control can filter from.</li>
</ul>

<p>The function must return:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <code>optionList</code> - the array of options, with the contents modified, added or removed
        as required.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    When using the Dynamic Filter and expecting the filters to be searchable with a dropdown typeahead as opposed to each filter
    being shown individually in a list, you may still want to have some filter options which are fixed in position and will
    always be visible. You can achieve this by modifying the set of filter options passed to the directive to include a set
    of <code>fixedOptions</code>. An example is shown below:
</p>

<uxd-snippet language="javascript" [content]="filterOptionsCode"></uxd-snippet>

<p>Passed to the directive as shown:</p>

<uxd-snippet language="html" [content]="filterCode"></uxd-snippet>
