<p>The <code>safeTimeout</code> service is a scope-safe way to execute delayed functions in your code. It provides a wrapper
    to the Angular <code>$timeout</code> service that will automatically cancel your timers when their scope is destroyed,
    preventing the memory leaks, race conditions and unexpected behaviour that can result from timers which have not been
    properly destroyed.</p>

<p>To use the <code>safeTimeout</code> service, <code>inject</code> it into your controller or directive in the same way you
    would normally inject the Angular <code>$timeout</code> service. Then call the constructor to get an instance that will
    be local to your execution context. The constructor takes the <code>$scope</code> variable as a parameter - this is used
    to listen for the <code>$destroy</code> event raised by Angular.</p>

<p>The returned instance has two methods.</p>

<div class="demo-attributes table-responsive">
    <table class="table m-t">
        <tr>
            <th>Name</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="attribute">timeout</td>
            <td>Two parameters, a function to execute and an optional delay in milliseconds. Returns a timer object.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td class="attribute">cancel</td>
            <td>One parameter, a timer object to be cancelled.</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</div>

<p>The signature of these methods is the same as that on the <code>$timeout</code> service. The example below shows how to defer
    execution using the safeTimeout service.</p>
